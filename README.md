# Princess Rescue Game

## Team Members:
- Nicole Molineros S.

## Project Description:
Princess Rescue is an interactive text-based adventure game where the player takes on the role of a hero tasked with rescuing a princess trapped in a dungeon. The game features combat mechanics, healing options, and random encounters with enemies such as goblins, witches, and a fierce dragon. Players navigate through different acts and storylines, leading to a final confrontation with the dragon that guards the princess.

The game leverages **OpenAL** to provide spatialized sound effects, adding an immersive audio dimension to the narrative. This includes directional sounds for attacks, healing, enemy death, and victory or defeat, making the gameplay more engaging.

### Gameplay Highlights:
- Combat system with choices to attack or heal.
- Randomized enemy behavior and player actions to create dynamic battles.
- Spatialized sounds to enhance immersion.
- Multiple narrative acts that guide the player through different parts of the dungeon.

### Clean Code Principles:
The project is structured using **Clean Code** principles to ensure that the code is not only functional but also easy to read, maintain, and expand in the future.

### Justification:

- **Python** was chosen for its clear and easy-to-use syntax, allowing for rapid development and a focus on game logic without additional complications. Its extensive libraries and community support facilitated integration and code management.

- **OpenAL** was selected for its ability to create spatial audio, adding an extra dimension to the player's experience. This makes sound effects more realistic and enhances immersion. OpenALâ€™s cross-platform compatibility ensures consistent audio performance across different operating systems.

Together, Python and OpenAL offer an effective combination of development simplicity and sophisticated audio features, resulting in an engaging and maintainable game.
